    M.A.A.S helps many people find jobs that fit their description that other job sites may not give.
    Making it easier for the user, so less work for you. We created M.A.A.S to help minorities find jobs that aren't always given
    to them in the work force. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, people of color make up nearly one-third of labor forces. M.A.A.S tries its very best
    to diversify the work force.
